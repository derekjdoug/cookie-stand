### Reflections and Comments

- Making CSS look great is hard. I need to improve my organization and make better use of selectors
- For the JavaScript stretch goals (most of which I ran out of time to complete), getting the interaction you want from multiple objects is difficult. I still need practice with this, but the knowledge is coming togther.
