### Reflections and Comments

- This lab felt a little easier logically for me, however I have found a few ways that I could have made my code more concise and combined methods.
- On a positive, I feel more confident using arrays and for loops at this point.
- I also enjoyed the DOM manipulation and that aspect of JavaScript. It's easy to see the utility in being able to perform it.
